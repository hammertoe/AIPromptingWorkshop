# Inspiration: Kate Kallot's Vision

**AI for Good Summit 2025, Geneva**

*"The AI revolution is not being written in Silicon Valley. It's coming from Manila, from Bridgetown, from Nairobi, from Accra, from Jakarta, and from Bangui."*

**Key Insights:**
- 90% of data centers in US & China, <1% in Africa
- Constraint-driven creativity is our superpower
- Local context creates competitive advantage

# The Global AI Divide: A Problem & Our Superpower

<style scoped>
.two-col {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 2rem;
}
</style>

<div class="two-col">
<div>

### The Problem (Kate Kallot's Insight)
- **Centralization of Power:** 90% of the world's data center capacity is in the US and China.
- **"Happening by Design":** Being left out of the AI future is not an accident. The system is designed to benefit those who build the infrastructure.
- **The Risk:** Becoming low-wage data labelers for Western models instead of authors of our own destiny.

</div>
<div>

### Our Superpower (Kallot's Reframe)
- **Constraint-Driven Creativity:** Limited resources are not a weakness; they are a forcing function for radical innovation and efficiency.
- **Local Context is Key:** It forces us to solve real, tangible problems for our communities.
- **The M-Pesa Example:** Kenya solved mobile payments for the unbanked *long before* Apple Pay because of local constraints.

</div>
</div>

*This isn't a race to catch up. It's a different race, one we are uniquely positioned to lead.*

*"What did I learn about machine learning last month?"*

---

# Common Patterns Across Projects

‚úÖ **Structured data** > clever prompts
üéØ **Real problems** drive innovation  
üèùÔ∏è **Local context** = competitive advantage
üîß **Constraint-driven** creativity

*You don't need Silicon Valley to build world-class AI*

# Large Language Models

| Model | Best For | Cost | Local Option |
|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| **Gemini** | Multimodal, cheap | $ | No |
| **Claude** | Reasoning, code | $$ | No |
| **GPT-4** | General purpose | $$$ | No |
| **Llama** | Privacy | Free | Yes |

**API considerations for Barbados**

---

# Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search

**How machines understand meaning:**
- Convert text ‚Üí numbers
- Similar meaning = similar numbers
- Search by concept, not keywords

**Tools:**
- Chroma (local)
- Pinecone (cloud)  
- MongoDB Atlas Search

---

# Knowledge Graphs

**Why structure matters:**
- AI needs memory & context
- Relationships between concepts
- Verifiable information sources

**Technologies:**
- RDF for standards
- Neo4j for graphs
- Simple JSON for prototypes

---

# LangChain & Orchestration

**Connecting LLMs to real data:**

```python
from langchain import OpenAI, VectorStore
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

llm = OpenAI()
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)
```

**Error handling & retries essential**

---

# Development Environment

**Essential Setup:**
- Python 3.9+ with pip
- VS Code + Python extension
- Git for version control
- API keys management

**Local vs Cloud:**
- Develop locally, deploy cloud
- Mind the data sovereignty

---

# Cost Management

**API Budget Planning:**
- Start with $10/month limits
- Monitor token usage
- Cache expensive operations
- Use cheaper models for development

**Rate limiting strategies**

---
