# The Global AI Divide: A Problem & Our Superpower

<div class="two-col">
<div>

### The Problem (Kate Kallot's Insight)
- **Centralization of Power:** 90% of the world's data center capacity is in the US and China.
- **"Happening by Design":** Being left out of the AI future is not an accident. The system is designed to benefit those who build the infrastructure.
- **The Risk:** Becoming low-wage data labelers for Western models instead of authors of our own destiny.

</div>
<div>

### Our Superpower (Kallot's Reframe)
- **Constraint-Driven Creativity:** Limited resources are not a weakness; they are a forcing function for radical innovation and efficiency.
- **Local Context is Key:** It forces us to solve real, tangible problems for our communities.
- **The M-Pesa Example:** Kenya solved mobile payments for the unbanked *long before* Apple Pay because of local constraints.

*This isn't a race to catch up. It's a different race, one we are uniquely positioned to lead.*

# Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search

**How machines understand meaning:**
- Convert text ‚Üí numbers
- Similar meaning = similar numbers
- Search by concept, not keywords

**Tools:**
- Chroma (local)
- Pinecone (cloud)  
- MongoDB Atlas Search

---

# Knowledge Graphs

**Why structure matters:**
- AI needs memory & context
- Relationships between concepts
- Verifiable information sources

**Technologies:**
- RDF for standards
- Neo4j for graphs
- Simple JSON for prototypes

---

# LangChain & Orchestration

**Connecting LLMs to real data:**

```python
from langchain import OpenAI, VectorStore
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

llm = OpenAI()
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)
```

**Error handling & retries essential**

---

# Development Environment

**Essential Setup:**
- Python 3.9+ with pip
- VS Code + Python extension
- Git for version control
- API keys management

**Local vs Cloud:**
- Develop locally, deploy cloud
- Mind the data sovereignty

---

# Cost Management

**API Budget Planning:**
- Start with $10/month limits
- Monitor token usage
- Cache expensive operations
- Use cheaper models for development

**Rate limiting strategies**

---

# Section 3: Building a Local AI Tool

*25 minutes to prototype*

---

# Problem Brainstorm

**Choose your challenge:**
üèñÔ∏è Tourism information scattered across platforms
üè™ Local business discovery & recommendations  
üìö Cultural knowledge preservation
üèõÔ∏è Government service navigation
üåä Climate/weather pattern analysis

**Form teams of 2-3 people**

---

# Building Phases

**Phase 1:** Data Collection (10 minutes)
**Phase 2:** AI Processing (10 minutes)  
**Phase 3:** User Interface (5 minutes)

*Don't aim for perfection - aim for working prototype*

---

# Phase 1: Data Collection

**Quick wins:**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Scrape a simple website
response = requests.get('https://example.com')
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
data = soup.find_all('div', class_='content')
```

**Tips:** Start simple, clean as you go

---

# Phase 2: AI Processing

**Gemini API Integration:**
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="your-key")
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

response = model.generate_content(
    f"Extract entities from: {text}"
)
```

**Focus:** Entity extraction, sentiment, categorization

---

# Phase 3: User Interface

**Streamlit for rapid prototypes:**
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My AI Tool")
query = st.text_input("Ask me anything:")

if query:
    result = process_with_ai(query)
    st.write(result)
```

**Keep it simple and functional**

---

# Demo Time!

**2 minutes per team:**
- Show your prototype
- Explain your approach  
- Share biggest challenge
- Discuss next iteration

*Remember: 25-minute prototype, not production system*

---

# Exercise Debrief

**Common challenges:**
- API rate limits
- Data cleaning complexity
- Integration difficulties

**Successful approaches:**
- Start with mock data
- Focus on core functionality
- Iterate quickly
