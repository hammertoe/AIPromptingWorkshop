# Leverage AI Tools to Accelerate Learning in Data Science
## 2-Hour AI Workshop Plan

**Duration:** 2 hours (120 minutes)  
**Audience:** Students and general learners interested in AI  
**Format:** Interactive workshop with demos, hands-on exercises, and discussion  
**Speaker:** Matt Hamilton

---

## Workshop Overview

This workshop challenges the notion that meaningful AI innovation only happens in Silicon Valley. Through real examples of AI projects built in Barbados, participants will learn practical skills while being inspired to become creators, not just consumers, of AI technology.

### Core Message
"Barbados has moved from sugar cane and tourism to exporting intelligence. With just a laptop and internet, you can compete globally. The AI revolution is being written in the Global South - and you're part of it."

---

## Detailed Schedule

### 🎬 **Opening: From Sugar Cane to Source Code** (15 minutes)

**Hook & Title Slide**
- Workshop introduction and overview
- Resources QR code introduction

**Personal Introduction** (Slide 2)
- Matt's journey: IBM → Ripple → Protocol Labs → Arbitrum → ASIMOV Protocol
- Moved to Barbados in 2020 on the Welcome Stamp during the pandemic
- Building blockchain/AI systems from Barbados
- Morning paddleboarding, afternoon building global AI systems

**Context Setting**
- **The Great Shift:** Used to need steel mills, factories, centrifuges to compete globally
- **Now:** Just need laptop + internet connection
- Barbados exports: sugar cane, tourism, culture → what else can we export?

**Kate Kallot's Global Context**
"I was recently inspired by a talk from Kate Kallot, the CEO of an African AI company called Amini. They are working with GovTech in Barbados. At the AI For Good Summit last week, she laid out the problem very clearly. The vast majority of AI's power—the data centers, the computing—is concentrated in just a couple of countries. She argues that the risk of the Global South being left behind isn't an accident. It's happening by design."

"But here's where it gets exciting. She says this isn't a story of weakness. It's a story of our hidden superpower. She calls it Constraint-Driven Creativity. When you don't have unlimited resources, you're forced to be more creative, more efficient, and to solve real problems. She points to M-Pesa in Kenya—a world-leading mobile payment system that was created because of local constraints, years before the West caught up."

"This isn't a race to catch up to Silicon Valley. It's a different race entirely, one that we are uniquely positioned to lead."

- 90% of AI infrastructure concentrated in US/China
- Being left out is "by design, not accident"
- **Counter-narrative:** Real AI revolution happening in Manila, São Paulo, Nairobi, Bridgetown
- Where "code meets community, data meets dignity"

**Workshop Goals**
- Inspire you to become AI creators, not just users
- Show practical tools and approaches
- Demonstrate that constraint drives creativity
